It looks like you've entered a long string of text with a lot of repetitive questions, but I'm not sure what you're trying to ask. To provide a helpful response, I'll try to summarize the question and provide a concise answer.

**What is Harry Potter?**

Harry Potter is a series of fantasy novels written by J.K. Rowling. The series follows the life of a young wizard named Harry Potter, who attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The series includes seven books: "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone," "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince," and "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows."

**Can you tell me full story of Harry Potter?**

Unfortunately, I couldn't find a single, comprehensive story about Harry Potter. The series is a series of books, not a single narrative. However, I can provide you with a brief summary of the main plot and characters:

The story begins with the discovery of a powerful magical artifact, the Philosopher's Stone. The stone is hidden at Hogwarts, and various students and teachers attempt to obtain it. Harry Potter, a young wizard, discovers that he is famous in the wizarding world because of his parents' love for him. He must navigate the challenges of being a "boy who lived" and confront the Dark Lord, Lord Voldemort.

Throughout the series, Harry and his friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, face numerous challenges and obstacles, including battles with Voldemort's followers, the Death Eaters. Along the way, they uncover the truth about Voldemort's past and the nature of his powers.

**Other questions:**

If you'd like to ask about other topics, feel free to ask and I'll do my best to provide a helpful response.

Note: I'll assume you're asking about the Harry Potter series, and if you have a specific question about the series, I'll do my best to provide a concise answer.
